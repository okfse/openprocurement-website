Metabase also allows you to download the data. For that you will need to naviagate to the dataset table, select the data you are interested in and click the cloud icon at the bottom right of the page and choosing your prefered format, as shown in the image below.

Please do not attempt to download the full dataset! Metabase is not a data registry and it was not built to download large data files. If your download fails, please try to split the data further and do several smaller downloads. If you are downloading a larger dataset, try using lighter formats such as .csv or .json rather than .xlsx. We are currently setting up a data registry so this limitation should be resolved soon.
